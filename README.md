These are teaching materials for two undergraduate level courses taught by me at Trinity College Dublin from 2023 onwards. As I taught them, courses were 10 weeks long, with 2-3 lectures per week but the practical activities can easily be adapted for different length courses and maybe even different levels (postgrad etc) although that might require more tweaking.

The climate science course is a second year module part of our Environmental Science and Engineering degree. it is meant to give a broad overview of atmospheric physics, the glboal carbon cycle, Earth System models and future climate projections. One of the main learning outcomes if to provide the students with sufficient knowledge to be able to access the climate literature for more in depth knowledge when needed during their studies and beyond. The students have only general prior experience of Earth system science and little to no programming knowledge. The materials provided are:

* Lecture slides - fort eh actual module, slides are updated every year with new figures from the Global Carbon Budget and up to date examples of things like climate extremes. For the purpose of this repository, I provide the slides used in 2025 and I will likely not upload new versions every year. Each lecture is 50 minutes long. Slide notes contain the source of any graphics used, either as a link or IPCC AR6 report figure number
* Practicals - three computer practicals coded in Matlab, meant to reinforce concepts from the lectures. The code is provided as links to Matlab online, and a leaching or individual student licence will be required to use the exercises. There are plans to transfer to R or Python, watch this space. 
* COP climate debate - a group role-playing activity meant to apply concepts learned throughout the course in the global context through groupwork and negotiation


Experimental design and analysis is a third year statistics module for biology and environmental science programmes.
